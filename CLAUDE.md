# AGENTS.md - Jack's Obsidian Vault

This is an **Obsidian vault** for personal knowledge management, not a code repository.
AI agents should treat this as a structured note-taking system with specific conventions.

## Linking Conventions

- **Internal links**: Use `[[Note Name]]` or `[[Note Name|Display Text]]`
- **Category references**: Always link to category pages like `"[[Books]]"`, `"[[People]]"`
- **Embed content**: Use `![[filename]]` for embeds (e.g., `![[Daily.base]]`)
- **Tags**: Use `#tag-name` format, prefer lowercase with hyphens

## Tag System

### Status Tags

## Template System

Templates live in `/Templates/` and use Templater syntax:

- Inspiration, Learning, Meetings, Movies, People, Places, Podcasts, Posts

## Content Guidelines for AI Agents

### DO:
- Preserve existing frontmatter structure when editing notes
- Use proper Obsidian link syntax `[[]]` for internal references
- Match existing tag conventions (lowercase, hyphenated)
- Create new notes in appropriate folders based on content type
- Use templates when creating new structured notes
- Respect the YYYY-MM-DD date format consistently

### DON'T:
- Modify `.obsidian/` configuration files
- Change `.base` query files without explicit request
- Remove or restructure existing frontmatter fields
- Create duplicate entries without checking existing notes
- Add images directly to root (use Files/ folder)
- Change established naming conventions

### When Creating New Notes:
1. Determine the correct category/folder
2. Use the appropriate template if one exists
3. Fill frontmatter with available information
4. Add proper category links (e.g., `categories: ["[[Books]]"]`)
5. Use consistent date formatting

## Git Configuration

The vault uses git with a whitelist approach:
```gitignore
*                           # Ignore everything by default
!Templates/                 # Except templates
!Templates/**
!Categories/                # Except categories
!Categories/**
!.obsidian/                 # Except Obsidian config
!.obsidian/**
.obsidian/workspace.json    # But ignore workspace state
.obsidian/graph.json        # And graph state
!.clipper-templates/        # Except clipper templates
!.clipper-templates/**
.DS_Store
!.gitignore
```

## Current Projects & Focus Areas

Based on `Home.md`, active areas include:
- Job search (Australia)
- [[LaxDB]] project
- [[Applied Epic Migration]]
- [[Running]]
- [[Books]] tracking

## Plugin Ecosystem

The vault uses Obsidian plugins. Key ones based on config:
- Daily Notes (configured for `/Daily/` folder)
- Templater (for template processing)
- Dataview (for `.base` queries)
- ZK Prefixer (for Zettelkasten-style IDs)
- Obsidian Web Clipper (browser extension)
